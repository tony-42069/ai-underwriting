## Summary

The repository 'ai-underwriting' is a Python library designed for automating commercial real estate document analysis and risk assessment. It has a well-defined structure but lacks critical components like testing and continuous integration. The code quality is generally good, but there are areas that need improvement, especially in documentation and testing.

## Stuck Areas

- Lack of test cases and CI/CD pipelines
- Incomplete implementation in some files, such as backend/api/documents.py
- TODO: bool = True

## Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive test cases for all major functionalities.
2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
3. Complete the implementation of functions marked as TODO or incomplete.
4. Enhance documentation, especially for API endpoints and configuration settings.
5. Address 6 TODO/FIXME items
6. Add or improve test coverage

## TODOs/FIXMEs

### BUG
- bool = True

### TODO
- Implement market data fetching from the market-data package
- Implement location extraction from document header or metadata
- Implement location extraction from document header or metadata
- Implement credit check integration
- Implement industry risk assessment

## Recommendations

1. Add unit and integration tests to cover all functionalities.
2. Use environment variables for sensitive information and paths.
3. Implement authentication for MongoDB connections to enhance security.
4. Consider using a linter and formatter to maintain code consistency.
5. Improve the README with detailed setup instructions and usage examples.
